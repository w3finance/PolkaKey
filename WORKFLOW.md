## UI for showcase

- There are three buttons at the top, click the first button the user can view PolkaKey source code on GitHub. And the second button represents the current network status of the computer, when the computer is online, it is a cry expression, when the computer is offline, it is a happy expression. The third button switch languages when clicked.
